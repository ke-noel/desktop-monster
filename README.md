# Desktop Monster - ConUHacks 2022

A (mostly) friendly chinchilla monster that hangs around your desktop and almost never steals your mouse.

## What it does
* The monster walks around the screen, wags its tail, and sleeps.
* Mouse over the monster to pet it. It'll fall asleep after a while. Be careful though, if you leave before it falls asleep, it'll get **angry**.
* When the monster is asleep, you can poke it by clicking on it. Don't do this too many times though, or it'll unleash its inner monster!
* When it gets angry, it tries to eat the cursor. Don't let it catch you! You won't be able to control the cursor until it falls asleep or gets bored.

### Safety features
* Middle click over the monster to get control of the mouse back.
* Right click over the monster to exit the program.

## Requirements
